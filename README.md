# Quake log parser

## About

This is a game log parser project that I've been learning ruby. The idea of the project is to extract informations of each game
and show the output in the console. For example: the players' names, who killed who, the ranking of the players...The project consist in two tasks and one plus.

Repository source [here](https://gist.github.com/akitaonrails/97310463c52467d2ecc6).


## Solution

I started opening the file [games.log](lib/games.log) and reading each line to extract informations like when a game begin and
end, after I catch the players' names and to store in the game class.


## Prerequisites

Install ruby in your local machine by typing:

`$ sudo apt-get intall ruby-full`

If you use windows enter [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/) to do the download of ruby.


## Running

Do a clone of this repo typing `$ git clone https://github.com/brunorafa-el/quake_log_parser.git` and run the project typing
`$ ruby main.rb` inside the [lib folder](lib/).


## My learning

My knowleadge about programming still is very small so to do a little part of this project was a big challeng for me but I
learned a lot of new things and that's what matters I believe.
